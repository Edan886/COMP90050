# COMP90050 Advanced database system

- Content: Many key techniques (theoretical aspects) in databases were introduced. Indexes, Distributed databases, Locking mechanisms, Crash recovery...

- Lecturer: I think Farhana is a very nice lecturer as she introduced each of the chapters in very detailed manner and many examples were provided (unlike many other male lecturers who love bullshitting their research and usefuless ideas..), which was useful not only for exam but also for deepening understanding of Database techniques.
